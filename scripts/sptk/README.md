Some useful scripts(work on python 3.6.5+) for speech enhancement integrated with kaldi, which could be used dependently.

1. Supervised beamformer based on mask prediction(kaldi's archive or numpy format)
2. Data convertion among MATLAB, Numpy and kaldi
3. Data visualization(mask, spectrogram...)
4. Data and IO handlers for kaldi's scripts, archives, wave, spectrogram, numpy's ndarray...
5. Faster CGMM trainer
6. Spatial/Spectral feature computation
7. ...

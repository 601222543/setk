what I want to do:

1. More efficient PSD matrix computation
2. Window normalization in ShortTimeFTComputer::InverseShortTimeFT()
3. Phase sensitive mask computation in compute-masks.cc
4. FastICA/SNMF(Sparse Non-negative Matrix Factor) algorithm
5. Beamformer debug and pipeline
6. Generalized localization algorithm
7. Using multi-channel input in apply-supervised-{mvdr,max-snr}.cc like apply-fixed-beamformer.cc
8. ...

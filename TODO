what I want to do:

1. More efficient PSD matrix computation
2. Phase sensitive mask computation in compute-masks.cc
3. FastICA/SNMF(Sparse Non-negative Matrix Factor) algorithm
4. Beamformer debug and pipeline
5. Generalized localization algorithm
6. Using multi-channel input in apply-supervised-{mvdr,max-snr}.cc like apply-fixed-beamformer.cc
7. ...
